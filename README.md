# Python RSA-Cryptography
Python implementation of the RSA Cryptography Algorithm
It generates public and private keys, encrypts messages with the public key, and decrypts them with the private key.
Makes use of modular exponentiation for efficient encryption and decryption.
Uses number theory concepts such as Fermat's Little theorem for prime generation
